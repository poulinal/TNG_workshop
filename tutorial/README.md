This workshop was created for the Spring 2024 STScI Symposium: Recipes to Regulate Star Formation at All Scales: From the Nearby Universe to the First Galaxies.
The STScI_TNG_workshop3.pptx file includes the slide deck that was presented at the symposium, and now includes notes for those that were not able to attend. I recommend reviewing the slides before beginning the Notebooks, as they introduce the simulation and the availble data types. 
There are a series of three notebooks to introduce users to downloading and working with TNG data.

IMPORTANT: you will need to update iapi_TNG.py with your IllustrisTNG API key to compile Notebook 1
If you do not have an API key, you can request one at: https:/www.tng-project.org/users/register/
In the meantime, the directory backup_data/ includes files that would be downloaded with Notebook 1 so that you can still complete the exercises in the other notebook.

Notebook 1 demonstrates how to interface with the TNG API using Python code and explores the structure of different TNG data types.

Notebooks 2 and 3 can be completed independently of each other.

In Notebook 2, you will practice identifying the star formation main sequence using data from the subhalo group catalogs and a supplementary catalog.

In Notebook 3, you will practice converting scale factors (given in the Merger Trees) to redshifts and lookback times. This can be useful for a variety of exercises, but in this case we use them to obtain luminosity-weighted ages and time-averaged SFRs from particle data. 


This workshop was conducted by Bryanne McDonough and the Jupyter notebooks were co-developed with Olivia Curtis.
